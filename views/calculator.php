    <h1>Calculator App</h1>
    <p>
        This JavaScript calculator was a simple project to explore JavaScript's
        prototype system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The calculator features a clean design, based on typography. It is
        easily customized through CSS. The design is also fully responsive,
        giving almost a native feel on mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        And what is an app that is not offline available? Nothing! So the
        demo-page is, once visited, available without any internet
        connection. And the final feature: this app is pinnable to the home screen.
