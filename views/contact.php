        <p>
            My name is Tom Hooijenga. I am a dutch software engineer that loves
            working with interactivity and animations. Most of my hobby-projects
            are built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and some PHP.

            Currently I work with <a href="http://www.oculustechnologies.nl/" target="_blank">Oculus Technologies</a>
            to build on their brand new platform. My job consists mostly of making
            interactive user-interfaces. I build these in C# with WPF.
